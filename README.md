## Project Overview

This application provides a platform for managing stores and collecting user ratings with role-based access control. The system supports three user types with distinct functionalities and permissions.

## User Roles & Functionalities

### üë®‚ÄçüíªSystem Administrator
**Full system control and management capabilities**

**User Management**
- Add new stores, normal users, and admin users
- View comprehensive user lists with Name, Email, Address, and Role
- Apply filters on all listings (Name, Email, Address, Role)
- View detailed user profiles including ratings for Store Owners

**Store Owner Creation Process**
- When creating a new store, administrator must select a Normal User from dropdown
- Upon store creation, the selected Normal User is automatically converted to Store Owner role  
- This ensures every store has an associated owner (‚ùóNote: The user must be created first before store creation)
- 
**Dashboard Analytics**
- Total number of users
- Total number of stores
- Total number of submitted ratings

**Store Management**
- View all stores with Name, Email, Address, and Rating
- Comprehensive store oversight

**‚ùóDatabase Management**
- Access and view all database records through Prisma Studio
- Real-time database inspection and management capabilities

**Account Management**
- Secure logout functionality

### üôéüèªNormal User
**Store discovery and rating capabilities**

**Account Management**
- Sign up with Name, Email, Address, Password
